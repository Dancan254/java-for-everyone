## Topics Covered

The repository is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific Java concept:

* **Introduction to Java:** Setting up the environment and writing the first program.
* **Variables and Data Types:** Understanding primitive types and variable declarations.
* **Control Flow Statements:** Implementing `if`, `else`, `switch`, loops, and more.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Exploring classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* **Collections Framework:** Utilizing lists, sets, maps, and their implementations.
* **Exception Handling:** Managing errors using try-catch blocks and custom exceptions.
* **Multithreading:** Introduction to concurrent programming in Java.
* **Unit Testing:** Writing tests using JUnit to ensure code reliability.
